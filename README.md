This dataset contains the annual average and three years average PM2.5
(particulate matter) concentration during 2000-2015 for the area of the
continental United States. All the datasets are in 1km of spatial resolution,
and in ESRI Img format. The unit is ug/m^3. This method is generated using
a machine learning-based geostatistical methods incorporating meteorological,
anthropogenic and geographic factors. Please refer the following paper for the
details:
